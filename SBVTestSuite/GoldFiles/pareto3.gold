this is wrong output from z3; second model is busted. trying to get to the bottom of it.

Pareto front #1: Optimal model:
  x            = 0 :: Integer
  min_x        = 0 :: Integer
  max_x_plus_x = 0 :: Integer
Pareto front #2: Optimal model:
  x            = 1 :: Integer
  min_x        = 0 :: Integer
  max_x_plus_x = 0 :: Integer
